  can you tell me more about him?
   ISKCON, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, was founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966 in New York City. He was born Abhay Charan De in 1896 in Calcutta, India. Prabhupada was a devout follower of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism tradition, a branch of Hinduism that venerates Lord Krishna as the supreme deity.

   Before founding ISKCON, Prabhupada spent much of his life as a practitioner of Krishna consciousness, studying the Bhagavad Gita and other Vaishnavite texts. In 1965, at the age of 69, he journeyed to the United States with the mission of spreading the teachings of Krishna.

   Despite facing numerous challenges, including financial difficulties and initial resistance from Western audiences unfamiliar with Eastern spirituality, Prabhupada persisted in his mission. He attracted followers, mostly young people disillusioned with mainstream society, and established the first ISKCON temple in New York City's Lower East Side.

   Prabhupada's teachings emphasized the importance of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra as a means of spiritual realization and advocated a simple, devotional lifestyle centered around Krishna consciousness. Under his guidance, ISKCON grew rapidly, establishing temples, ashrams, and communities worldwide.

   Prabhupada's leadership and scholarly contributions were instrumental in popularizing the Hare Krishna movement globally. He translated and commented on numerous Hindu scriptures, including the Bhagavad Gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam, making them accessible to Western audiences.

   Despite his passing in 1977, Prabhupada's legacy continues to inspire millions of devotees within ISKCON and beyond. He is revered as the movement's founder and spiritual guide, whose teachings continue to shape the lives of countless individuals seeking spiritual fulfillment.
