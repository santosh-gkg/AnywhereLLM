# AnywhereLLM 🚀

AnywhereLLM is a tool that allows users to leverage language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 for various tasks without leaving their current application. Users can input text, summarize it for long-term memory, and generate responses based on context and typed strings.

## Features ✨

- **Text Summarization:** Users can summarize text for long-term memory using GPT-3, providing context for subsequent interactions.
- **Content Generation:** Generate responses or perform tasks based on typed strings and the context provided by the long-term memory.
- **Hotkey Integration:** Use customizable hotkeys to add content, generate responses, and clear long-term memory without interrupting workflow.
